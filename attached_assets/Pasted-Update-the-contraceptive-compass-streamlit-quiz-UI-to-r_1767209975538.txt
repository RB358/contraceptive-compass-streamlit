Update the contraceptive-compass-streamlit quiz UI to replace the current “Quiz started…” box, “Back to top”, and existing “Restart quiz” controls with a progress bar based on COMPLETED questions.

Context:
- The quiz uses conditional rendering (one question shown at a time).
- There are exactly 7 questions.
- The quiz advances only when the user clicks Next / Submit.

DO NOT change:
- Question text
- Answer logic
- Scoring or recommendation logic
- The working Start button on the landing page

--------------------------------
1) Remove existing UI elements
--------------------------------
Delete entirely from the quiz flow:
- The “Quiz started…” status/info box
- “Back to top”
- The current “Restart quiz” button or link

Ensure none of these render on any quiz question screen.

--------------------------------
2) Add a progress indicator (completed-question model)
--------------------------------
Add a progress indicator at the top of the quiz area that appears on every question screen (but NOT on the landing page).

The progress indicator must consist of:
- A text label: “Question X of 7”
- A Streamlit native progress bar: st.progress(...)

IMPORTANT: Progress must be calculated from COMPLETED questions, not the current question being answered.

Assume:
- `current_question` is 0-based
- `current_question` is incremented only AFTER the user submits a question

Then define:
- completed_questions = st.session_state.current_question
- X (displayed question number) = completed_questions + 1
- progress_fraction = completed_questions / 7

Render:
- Label text: “Question X of 7”
- Progress bar value: progress_fraction

This ensures:
- Question 1 shows 0% progress
- Clicking Next immediately advances the bar to 1/7
- Question 7 starts at 6/7 and reaches 100% on completion

--------------------------------
3) Placement and layout
--------------------------------
- Render the label and progress bar immediately before the question content.
- Keep spacing compact (no large margins or cards).
- The progress bar should not scroll independently or jump the layout.

--------------------------------
4) Results page behavior
--------------------------------
On the results page:
- Set progress to 1.0 (100%)
- Either:
  a) Keep the progress bar visible at 100%, OR
  b) Hide it entirely
Choose one and apply consistently.

--------------------------------
5) Restart behavior (optional, minimal UI)
--------------------------------
If restart functionality is required:
- Add a small “Restart” text link BELOW the progress bar, aligned right.
- Do NOT reintroduce a large button or banner.
- Clicking Restart should reset:
  - current_question
  - stored answers
  - any quiz-started flags
- Then return the user to Question 1 or the landing page.

--------------------------------
6) Verification checklist
--------------------------------
Confirm:
- “Quiz started…”, “Back to top”, and old Restart controls are fully removed
- Progress shows 0% on Question 1
- Progress advances immediately after each Next click
- Label always matches the visible question number
- Progress reaches 100% at completion
- Quiz logic and navigation remain unchanged
