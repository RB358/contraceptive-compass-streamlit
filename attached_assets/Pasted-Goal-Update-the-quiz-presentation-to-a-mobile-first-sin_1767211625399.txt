Goal: Update the quiz presentation to a mobile-first single-column layout with large question text and tappable option tiles (Frank Body mobile layout inspiration, but keep clinical tone). The quiz uses conditional rendering per question.

Constraints:
- Questions 1–5 and 7: single-select
- Question 6: multi-select (toggle multiple tiles)
- Next button disabled until selection is valid (single: one selected; multi: >=1 selected)
- Inline navigation (no sticky footer)
- Use consistent tile styling across the whole app
- Do NOT change question wording, scoring, recommendation logic, or routing.

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (preferred approach: custom tile component using session_state, not st.radio styling hacks)

1) Create a reusable tile selector helper
- Add a function (e.g., in the main file or a ui_components.py) called:
  a) render_single_select_tiles(question_key, options) -> selected_option or None
  b) render_multi_select_tiles(question_key, options) -> list[str] selected options
- These render each option as a clickable “tile” and store selection in st.session_state.

2) Tile rendering method (single-select)
- For each option:
  - Render a button-like element that is visually a tile.
  - On click: set st.session_state[question_key] = that option, then st.rerun()
- Use a stable CSS class for tiles and a “selected” variant class when the option matches current selection.
- Ensure large tap targets and rounded corners.

3) Tile rendering method (multi-select; Question 6 only)
- Store selection as a list (or set) in st.session_state[question_key].
- For each option:
  - On click: toggle membership in the list (add if missing, remove if present), then st.rerun()
- Selected tiles should show a clear state change.

4) Disable Next until selection exists
- For single-select: valid if st.session_state[question_key] is not None
- For multi-select: valid if len(st.session_state[question_key]) >= 1
- Implement Next disabled using st.button(..., disabled=not valid) if supported.
- If disabled parameter is not available in your Streamlit version, emulate:
  - Render Next only when valid, otherwise render a visually-muted placeholder button that does nothing (or render help text “Select an option to continue.”).

5) Layout styling (mobile-first column, “Frank Body mobile feel”)
- Center the quiz content in a narrow column across all devices:
  - max-width ~480–520px
  - width: 100%
  - margin: 0 auto
- Remove any “card/white panel” above the question (no extra box backgrounds/borders/shadows).
- Question text:
  - Larger font size, strong line height
  - Minimal UI above it: progress bar + subtle Restart link only
- Spacing:
  - Tight, consistent vertical rhythm (avoid Streamlit default giant gaps).
- Keep everything inline (no sticky bottom bar).

6) Consistent tile styling across app
- Add CSS once (global) for:
  - .cc-tile (base tile)
  - .cc-tile--selected (selected state)
  - .cc-tile--multi (optional, but keep identical visuals)
- Tiles:
  - full width
  - rounded corners (e.g., 18–24px)
  - consistent padding
  - clear selected state (border weight + subtle background)
  - hover/focus state (desktop accessibility)
- Do NOT introduce per-question styling unless absolutely required.

7) Progress bar and restart placement
- Keep Option A progress logic:
  - step = current_question + 1
  - progress = step / 7
- Place progress label + bar at top of quiz area.
- Place “Restart” as a low-key text link aligned right under the progress bar (no capsule styling).

8) Verify behavior
- Q1 shows progress 1/7 and Next disabled until selection.
- Q6 allows multiple selections; Next disabled until at least one tile selected.
- Navigation works; scoring/recommendations unchanged.
- Layout looks like a mobile-first guided quiz on desktop too (centered narrow column).
