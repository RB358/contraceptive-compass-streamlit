Update the quiz question screen UI (conditional rendering per question). Do not change scoring, recommendation logic, or question copy content. Implement the following:

A) Navigation row: Back / Restart / Next (Restart located between)
1) Replace the current placement of Restart so that the bottom navigation row contains three controls, aligned in one row:
   - Left: Back
   - Center: Restart (low-key)
   - Right: Next (primary)
2) Restart must be visually low emphasis (text link style), but still tappable and accessible (reasonable tap target).

B) Button hierarchy: Next is primary, Back is secondary
1) Next button must have stronger visual weight than Back:
   - Next: filled/primary styling (the existing “white capsule” style you used for Start is acceptable if consistent)
   - Back: secondary styling (outline or text-button; no shadow; less contrast than Next)
2) Ensure Back does not visually compete with Next:
   - smaller weight, less prominent border/fill
   - keep label simple (“Back”)
3) Restart should be the lowest emphasis (text only).

Implementation note:
- Do NOT rely on Streamlit’s variant testids (they change). Wrap each button area in a stable class using a single st.markdown call, e.g.:
  - <div class="cc-nav">
      <div class="cc-nav-left">[Back button renders here]</div>
      <div class="cc-nav-mid">[Restart renders here]</div>
      <div class="cc-nav-right">[Next renders here]</div>
    </div>
- Apply CSS to style buttons within these wrappers.

C) No scrolling during quiz questions (fixed viewport)
Goal: Each question screen must fit entirely within the viewport on mobile and desktop. Users must not scroll while answering.

1) Remove the quiz image entirely
- Delete any hero/illustration/image rendering shown on question screens.
- Ensure no image containers remain that reserve vertical space.

2) Apply quiz-only “fixed viewport” layout contract
- When quiz is active (started == True and before results), apply CSS that:
  - locks the app to the viewport: height: 100dvh
  - disables vertical scrolling at the correct wrapper level
  - uses a column layout with a fixed bottom nav row

Required CSS behavior (quiz-only):
- .stApp { height: 100dvh; overflow: hidden; }
- section.main { overflow: hidden; }
- Remove Streamlit vertical padding that causes overflow:
  div[data-testid="stMainBlockContainer"] { padding-top: 0; padding-bottom: 0; }

3) Structure the quiz screen into 3 vertical zones
- Zone 1 (top): progress label + progress bar (compact)
- Zone 2 (middle): question text + answer tiles (this zone flexes/shrinks)
- Zone 3 (bottom): nav row with Back/Restart/Next (fixed height)

Implement this via a wrapper container using CSS grid or flex:
- Prefer CSS grid:
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto
  height: 100dvh
  overflow: hidden

Critical: ensure the middle zone can shrink without forcing scroll:
- middle zone must have min-height: 0

4) Tighten spacing for small screens
To guarantee no scroll on small mobiles:
- reduce vertical margins around question and tiles
- use responsive font sizing with clamp() for the question prompt
- reduce tile padding slightly at small heights (max-height: 750px)
- ensure tiles remain tappable (do not go below comfortable tap target height)

5) Validation
- On every question screen: no scroll bar; mouse wheel does nothing; mobile swipe does not scroll.
- All elements visible at once:
  progress, question prompt, all answer tiles, nav row.
- Next disabled until valid selection (single: one selected, Q6: >=1 selected) remains intact.
- Back works; Restart resets state; Next advances.
